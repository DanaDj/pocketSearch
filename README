                      ##############

A program that combines the pocket detecting, nearest neighbor
algorithms of fpocket 3.1 with the Voronoi diagram building and
analysis programs, SURF/VASP to qualify good candidates for protein
engineering. The output of this program is a Rosetta pose file for
computational mutagenesis.
